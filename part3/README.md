# Note about this part

## Heroku Interface

* https://lit-bayou-25616.herokuapp.com/


## Frontend

This folder contains the source code for the frontend of the project. It has been tested that it runs both on localhost and on Heroku.

## Heroku

This folder used to be called backend. There used to be a dotenv file. Now it's deleted because the URL as an environment variable is set using Heroku CLI.
